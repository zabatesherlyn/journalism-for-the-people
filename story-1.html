  <h2>City Faces Housing Crisis</h2>
  <p class="meta">By Alex Writer · Dec 18, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The city’s housing crisis has intensified as rents continue to rise
    and affordable housing options remain limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Residents report being forced to relocate as landlords increase rents
    beyond what working families can afford.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advocates are calling for stronger tenant protections and increased
    investment in public housing.
